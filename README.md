# Data_Structure_In_C
This repository contains implementations of common data structures in the C programming language. The implemented data structures are:  
- Stack (Array-based and Linked list-based)
- Queue (Array-based and Linked list-based)
- Doubly Linked List

## Stack  
The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. The stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The stack using linked list allows you to push any number of elements you want without preidentification of it and saving the memory. It supports many operations:  
- push (to insert an element)
- pop (to remove the topmost element)
- printStack (to print all elements )
- clearStack (to remove all elemnts )
- stackSize (to determine the number of elements)
